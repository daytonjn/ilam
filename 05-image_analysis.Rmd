# Post-Process Image Segmentation

Below is a walk-through for the post-process image segmentation (i.e., blob identification) of iLAM images 

**1. Organize your file directory structure in a logical structure**

  - Universal iLAM functions are within ```~/iLAM/scripts/```
  - ```~/iLAM/exp_a/``` contains images, metadata, and analysis scripts specific to Experiment A
  - Experiment A's images from ilam_01 and ilam_02 are saved in ```~/iLAM/exp_a/ilam_01/``` and ```~/iLAM/exp_a/ilam_02/```, respectively
  - CSV output containing the size, location, and timing of all blobs/movements for each iLAM cages for Experiment A (i.e., ilam_01 and ilam_02):```~/iLAM/exp_a/iLAM_exp_a.txt/```, with corresponding metadata: ```~/iLAM/exp_a/metadata_exp_a.csv/```

```{r, fig.cap='Directory structure for iLAM analysis', echo=FALSE}

library(data.tree)

path <- c(
    "iLAM/exp_a/ilam_01/ilam01.0707.2058.jpg",
    "iLAM/exp_a/ilam_01/ilam01.0707.2100.jpg",
    
    "iLAM/exp_a/ilam_02/ilam02.0707.2058.jpg",
    "iLAM/exp_a/ilam_02/ilam02.0707.2100.jpg",
    
    "iLAM/exp_a/scripts/analyze_experiment.R",
    "iLAM/exp_a/scripts/exp_a_ilam01.R",
    "iLAM/exp_a/scripts/exp_a_ilam02.R",

    "iLAM/exp_a/scripts/run_exp_a_ilam01.sh",
    "iLAM/exp_a/scripts/run_exp_a_ilam02.sh",

    "iLAM/exp_a/metadata_exp_a.csv",
    "iLAM/exp_a/iLAM_exp_a.txt",
    
    "iLAM/exp_b/ilam_01/",
    "iLAM/exp_b/ilam_02/",
    "iLAM/exp_b/scripts/",
    
    "iLAM/scripts/find_movements.R",
    "iLAM/scripts/find_threshold.R", 
    "iLAM/scripts/make_dam_file.R", 
    "iLAM/scripts/make_gif.R", 
    "iLAM/scripts/parse_movements.R", 
    "iLAM/scripts/plot_movements.R"
)

mytree <- data.tree::as.Node(data.frame(pathString = path))
print(mytree)
```

**2. Perform image segmentation for images taken from each iLAM (exp_a_ilam01.R, exp_a_ilam02.R, etc.)**

  - Load required packages and iLAM functions
```
 library(imager)
 library(tidyverse)
 library(reshape2)
 library(dplyr)
 library(plyr)
 library(lubridate)
 library(readr)
 library(stringr)
 library(plotrix)

setwd("/~/iLAM/exp_a/")

 #read in iLAM functions
 for (f in list.files("../scripts", pattern="*.R",
                      full.names = TRUE)) {
   source(f)

```

  - Change values for every cage and experiment: crop (x_left, x_right, etc.), settings for image segmentation (blur, threshold, clean), species characters (genus, species, color)
```
pi_sub_folder <- "ilam01"
sex <- "male" #cage/project-specific

#Crop-settings
x_left <- 425 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement
x_right <- 2225 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement
y_bot <- 100 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement
y_top <- 1700 #cage-specific, depending on camera arrangement

#change following values for every experiment
out_file_name = "iLAM_exp_a" #project-specific
n_thr = 0.999 #species-specific, depending on IR reflectance/contrast with background
n_cln = 10 #species-specific, depending on IR reflectance
n_max = 75000 #species-specific, pixel differences above this value will be considered as noise
start_photophase = 5 #project-specific, time that lights turn on
end_photophase = 21 #project-specific, time that dark starts
genus = "photinus" #project-specific
species = "marginellus" #project-specific
animal = "black" #project-specific, during the night, does the animal appear "white" on a dark background or "black" on a light background? This is VERY important (!) because it determines whether "movements" identify insects whom left vs. arrived between frames 
###
```

  - Create a vector of .jpg image file names to be analyzed
```
file_names <- list.files(pi_sub_folder,
                         pattern= "*.jpg",
                         full.names = TRUE)
```

*Note: If you do not know which values to use for cropping (x_left, x_right, y_bot, y_top), you can test with this command. Historically, we identify crop setting that a) remove the outer edge of the cage and to center the ceiling and b) keep the picture area constant across all iLAMs (e.g., 1800x1600 pixels)*

``` 
load.image(file_names[1]) %>%
imsub(x %inr% c(x_left,x_right), y %inr% c(y_bot,y_top)) %>% plot()
```

  - Find all movements by image subtraction, global thresholding, and blob detection in the iLAM wrapper function ```find_movements()```
```
out <- find_movements(files = file_names, # list of file names 
                      n_thr = n_thr,      # threshold value (0.992 == "0.8%")
                      n_cln = n_cln,      # value for cleaning (number of pixels)
                      n_grw = 1.5,      # multiplier for n_cln (shrink vs. grow)
                      n_blr = 3,          # let user select blur radius
                      n_max = 75000,      # upper cut-off for # pixel differences
                      x_left = x_left,    # value for crop on x min
                      x_right = x_right,  # value for crop on x max
                      y_bot = y_bot,      # value for crop on y min
                      y_top = y_top,      # value for crop on y max
                      find_thr = T, # T or F
                      type_thr = "absolute",
                      p_sample = 0.05,    # If 5% of the total images < 100, then increase this value
                      channel = "grayscale",
                      animal = animal)
```

  - Update and save output containing all identified blobs, their size and location as a .csv in the current working directory. **Important: Even under optimal setting, sometimes there are "noisy" timepoints when blobs cannot easily be identified after subtracting two consecutive images. In these instances, 2,000,000 is assigned to the .csv for subsequent filtering and removal**

```
#adds additional columns to dataframe
out$ID <- paste0(n_thr*100,"%_", "s", n_cln, "g", 1.5*n_cln)
out$sex <- sex
out$genus <- genus
out$species <- species

if (file.exists(paste0(out_file_name,".csv"))){
  write.table(out, file = paste0(out_file_name,".csv"),
              append = TRUE, quote = TRUE, sep = ",",
              row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
} else{
  write.csv(out, file = paste0(out_file_name,".csv"),
            col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
  
}
rm(out)
```

  - Use ```plot_movements()``` to visualize movements by plotting detected blobs onto a subset of images
```
#circles in bottom left corner denote standards of sizes: 12.8k px, 3.2k px, 800 px, 200 px, 50 px
plot_movements(pi_sub_folder,
               by_change,
               x_left, x_right,
               y_bot, y_top)
```
```{r j, fig.cap='iLAM plot_movements() image', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ilam_plot_movement.jpg")
```

  - If desired, make a gif from plotted images with  ```make_gif() ```
 
```
make_gif(out_file_name,
          pi_sub_folder)
```

```{r k, fig.cap='iLAM make_gif() output', echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ilam_photinus.gif")
```

*Note: For more details/customization, look "under-the-hood" at the ```find_movements()``` and ```find_threshold()``` functions*
