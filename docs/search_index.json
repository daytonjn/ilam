Although many systems are cheaper than the traditional infrared locomotor activity monitors (e.g., DAM/LAM), these options remain complicated to build and/or computationally intensive. We developed the imaging Locomotor Activity Monitor (iLAM), an affordable system for activity tracking. The iLAM utilizes a Raspberry Pi Zero W computer and night-vision camera inside a flight cage to regularly photograph a population of insects at user-defined intervals. Customizable, modular R-scripts process the consecutive images with imager and output a file containing the number, size, location, and timing of all identified movements. Output can be converted into DAM format or directly analyzed within the Rethomics framework.
