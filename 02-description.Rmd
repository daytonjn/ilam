# Description
  Historically, most insect chronoecological research uses direct observations, cameras, and/or infrared beam-based monitors to quantify movement across timed intervals. Although many systems are cheaper than the traditional infrared locomotor activity monitors (e.g., DAM/LAM), these options remain complicated to build and/or computationally intensive.  
  
  We developed the **imaging Locomotor Activity Monitor (iLAM)**, an affordable system for activity tracking. The iLAM utilizes a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) computer and night-vision camera inside a flight cage to regularly photograph a population of insects at user-defined intervals.
  
  Customizable, modular R-scripts process the consecutive images with [*imager*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/) and output a file containing the *number*, *size*, *location*, and *timing* of all identified movements. Output can be converted into DAM format or directly analyzed within the [*Rethomics*](https://rethomics.github.io/) *framework*.
